# SADX Debug Mode by PkR

Debug Mode is a mod for Sonic Adventure DX PC (2004) that displays various debug information on screen. You need SADX Mod Loader to use this mod. 

**Using the mod**

1) Press the Z button on the controller or the B key on the keyboard to toggle between different debug information screens.
2) If you press the Z button (or the B key on the keyboard) while also holding the A button (or its keyboard counterpart), vanilla debug mode will be enabled. To disable it, press the same button/key combination again.

For better legibility enable the "Hide HUD" code in SADX Mod Manager before running the game with this mod.

**Using the vanilla debug mode**

This is SADX' built-in debug mode (what's left of it). Collision objects are visible in this mode.
When this mode is enabled, you can move the character freely through any obstacles. Use the analog stick to position the character on the X and Z plane. Hold the X button to move the character up and down.

Notes:
1) Vanilla debug mode is unavailable for Gamma. 
2) For Tails and Big it will display collision objects but free movement will not be available.
